Once defined, you can reference this parameter value from any other configuration file using a special syntax: 
wrap the parameter name in two % (e.g. %app.admin_email%):

You can reference environment variables using the special syntax %env(ENV_VAR_NAME)%. 
The values of these options are resolved at runtime (only once per request, to not impact performance).
url: '%env(resolve:DATABASE_URL)%' --> in config file

The .env file is read and parsed on every request and its env vars are added to the $_ENV & $_SERVER PHP 
variables. Any existing env vars are never overwritten by the values defined in .env, so you can combine 
both.

Use environment variables in values by prefixing variables with $:
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=${DB_USER}pass # include the user as a password prefix

In production, the .env files are also parsed and loaded on each request. So the easiest way to define 
env vars is by creating a .env.local file on your production server(s) with your production values.
